# TLC NYC Application Status Checker
[View the working demo](https://tlc-status.herokuapp.com/)

This app was created as an experiment for working with the [NYC Open Data API](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/New-Driver-Application-Status/dpec-ucu7/data)

It gives you the ability to enter in the application number for a TLC license, and
view completed and missing requirements for an application. The existing process
requires that an applicant manually sorts through a large excel spreadsheet for
their application info
